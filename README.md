### 🌟 Introduction

No room in your place for a real drum kit?
<br/>
 'Drum Beatz' lets you try the true drumming experience in any music style!

 A free, fun, user-friendly app! 
It is perfect for practicing without bugging the neighbours or taking up too much space.

### 🎶 How Does It Work

The app transforms your phone/tablet/pc screen into a lifelike simulation of a drum kit. Watch as your fingertips magically transform into drumsticks! For instant playback, all you need do is tap on the drum pads.
