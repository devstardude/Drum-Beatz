### Introduction 🙋‍♂️
---
No room in your place for a real drum kit?
<br/>
 'Drum Beatz' lets you try the true drumming experience in any music style! 
 <br/>
 A free, fun, user-friendly app! 
It is perfect for practicing without bugging the neighbours or taking up too much space.
<br/>

### How Does It Work 🎶
---
The app transforms your phone/tablet/pc screen into a lifelike simulation of a drum kit. Watch as your fingertips magically transform into drumsticks! For instant playback, all you need do is tap on the drum pads.
<br/>

I made this app during my Initial days of learning Web development. <br/>

Also It helped me to overcome my second thoughts of getting into Web Development.
